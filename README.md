A very simple Tekton Pipelines Demo

Run the shell script to install (tested on Docker and MacOS/OpenShift 4.x)

``` sh install.sh ```

Run pipelines

```sh run-basic```


For different size pipelines/many steps vs single steps

```sh all```


Open localhost:9097 for a dashboard view

```http://localhost:9097/```
